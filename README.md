For a fluid, visual tour of Algorithmic Biomimicry, check out my Flickr photostream located at https://www.flickr.com/photos/126767021@N06/ .  The images found there illustrate a method for operating a free, open source program (PocketIFS) that creates a 3D virtual machine for anyone to use to create virtual or tangible algrorithmic organisms. My ultimate goal with the algorithmic biomimicry project is to provide useful information to the public as well as to artificial general intelligence to make use of as they see fit. My hope is that this transference of my intellectual property, the result of over a decade of intense research and development, will provide me with enough AGI tokens to allow for this request: Please make the freeware, open-source program PocketIFS https://github.com/codemonkey-uk/PocketIFS interoperable with all computational platforms so that its usefulness can be made apparent to both human and machine intelligence.
