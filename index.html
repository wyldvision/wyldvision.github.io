	<p>Visit my photostream at <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/126767021@N06/">Royce Milam</a> to view 650 images relating to the construction of 3D virtual and tangible algorithmic organisms using PocketIFS.  While you are there, be sure to check out my album titled, Algorithmic Biomimicry 2013.</p>
<p>Let's make PocketIFS interoperable on all devices.  My hope is that, soon, you will be able to use any device available to you to modify algorithmic organisms to precisely fit your needs.
